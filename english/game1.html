            After the Second World War, Slovakia gained a certain degree <br>of independence. The escalation of the political situation in 1968 led to the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic becoming a federation of sovereign nation states – the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic.
            <br>In 1990, ethnic disputes escalated over the name of the federation and state symbols. <br>In Slovakia, there were tendencies to establish a Slovak army, Slovak police, <br>and a Slovak national bank. 
            The dissolution of Czechoslovakia was supported by all major Slovak political parties and top politicians.

          The tradition of cooperatives existed in the Czech lands long before the communist times. <br>At that time, it was <br>an association of farmers formed to share the distribution of production, and for mutual assistance. <br>However, the farmers remained the owners of their lands <br>and agricultural units.    
          Above all, the communist cooperatives abolished the very essence <br>of ownership since the property was now owned by the cooperative and the farmers were its employees. Proposals for new kinds of cooperative ownership after 1990 included, for example, a new form <br>of profit sharing and other principles of free market.

          <p>A total of 85% of voters took part in the elections. These were the last parliamentary elections before the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.</p> 
          <br>
          <p>ODS, in coalition with KDS, won the first place and was way ahead of the rest. They won 30% of all votes and 76 seats. They entered the elections with a clear vision <br>of rapid privatization and with the support of the private sector.   </p>
          <br>
          <p>The Left Bloc was second with a total of 33 seats. It achieved this result mainly thanks to KSČM.</p>
          <br>
          <p>ČSSD remained true to its social ideals. It reached 6.5% of voters, thanks to which <br>it won 16 seats.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Liberal Social Union, a coalition of three parties focused on environmental issues, scored decent results as well.</p>             
          <br>
          <p>Despite its interesting programme, the joke Friends of Beer Party had the worst results of all with 84,000 votes.</p>
